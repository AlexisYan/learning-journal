At day 3, we leaned how to use javascript create a game. We used if statement and for loop.
I made some mistakes in my homework, but I learned that we can't put a if statement in a if statement. also when we use for loop to run an array, the result shows one by one. so if we want to check if something is in the array we need to use the variable in the for loop equal to the array's length - 1.
