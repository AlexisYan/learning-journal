In the past two days, I've learned how to use command line to create a directory.
We can use touch to update or create a new file and directory is basically a folder.
 cd is for changing directory and pwd is showing where you are at.

Also we learned that <!DOCTYPE html> is a declaration for HTML5 and how to link script and css into html. Most tags come in pairs but its not necessary. Most code in html is like a box, you can put numbers, strings in the box. we also learned the function prompt and if statement.
